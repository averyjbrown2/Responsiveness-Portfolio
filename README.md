Responsiveness Portfolio

This project was extremely difficult for me. However, I learned that spacing and indentation plays a critical role in how a webpage displays. This project works well because it is, as its name decclares, a responsive portfolio. The adaptability of webpages is incredibly important, these days wherein consumers surf the web in a variety of forms: laptops, phones, tablets. I appreciate the opportunity that I had to work on such an exciting and current project.
